# Lab 03 — Ad-hoc Wi-Fi: Multi-hop Throughput, TCP vs UDP, Hidden Terminals (ns-3)


## What this lab is about

You’ll build small **ad-hoc Wi-Fi** networks in ns-3 and measure **application-level throughput** while you vary (a) **hops** and (b) **payload size**. Then you’ll compare **TCP vs UDP** on a 3-node chain. Finally, you’ll reproduce the **hidden-terminal** problem and show how **RTS/CTS** changes the results. 

Core settings you must stick to for the multi-hop experiments: **802.11b**, **constant 1 Mb/s PHY** (no rate fallback), **Two-Ray Ground propagation**, nodes in a **line** with **200 m** spacing so **only adjacent nodes can hear each other** (that’s how we force multi-hop). Also: **routing must be enabled** between stations.

## What we provide (starters) and what they actually do

* **`Lab3_Cpp_Adhoc.cc`** — baseline **UDP** multi-hop chain. It sets **802.11b** with **ConstantRate 1 Mb/s**, **AdhocWifiMac**, and **Two-Ray Ground**; places nodes on a line at `distance * i`; runs an **OnOff UDP** app from node 0 to the **last** node; records throughput with **FlowMonitor** over the **1–10 s** send window (i.e., 9 seconds). It also writes a **NetAnim** XML.    

* **`Lab3_Cpp_PayloadSweep.cc`** — same radio/topology, but loops over **payload sizes `{300,700,1200}`** and prints throughput per case. Use it to automate the payload sweep.  

* **`Lab3_Cpp_TCP.cc`** — 3-node **TCP** chain at positions **0/200/400 m**; sets TCP **segment size** to `pktSize`; drives a high **5 Mb/s** OnOff source to saturate the link; computes throughput from FlowMonitor. **Gotcha:** apps send from **1–10 s** (9 s), but this starter divides by **10**; if you want apples-to-apples with UDP, divide by **9**.   

* **`Lab3_Cpp_Hidden.cc`** — the **hidden-terminal** demo: three nodes on a line **STA0 — AP — STA1** (infrastructure MAC, on purpose), two **UDP** senders into the AP, payload **1000 B**, **1 Mb/s**, **RTS/CTS** toggled via `RtsCtsThreshold` (**0 = on**, **2200 = off**). Throughput is again measured over the 1–10 s window.    

> Heads-up: the hidden-terminal starter uses **AP/STA** roles (infrastructure) because that cleanly demonstrates two hidden senders colliding at the AP. That’s fine for the concept, even though the chain experiments are **ad-hoc (IBSS)**. **Also, please read through the comments in the code.**

## What you must run and report

### Part 1 & 2 — Multi-hop UDP (the main study)

* Use **802.11b / DsssRate1Mbps**, **ConstantRate**, **Two-Ray**, **200 m** spacing, **IBSS**. Sender is **node 0**; **last node** is the receiver. Measure **average application throughput**. 
* Vary **number of stations**: `{3, 4, 5, 6}`. Vary **UDP payload**: `{300, 700, 1200}`. For **each** combination, compute throughput. 
* Plots you must produce:

  * **Throughput vs packet size** for **each** hop count. 
  * **Throughput vs number of stations** at **1200 B**. 
* Also: **compare PHY nominal 1 Mb/s vs your measured app throughput** and explain the gap. 

### Part 3 — TCP vs UDP (3-node chain)

* Run **TCP** on the **3-node** chain with **segment size = {300, 1200}**, and compare **application throughput** to UDP. Keep the same radio/topology settings. 
* To change TCP segment size:
  `Config::SetDefault("ns3::TcpSocket::SegmentSize", UintegerValue(pktSize));` (already in the starter). 

### Part 4 — Hidden terminals (RTS/CTS off vs on)

* Two UDP senders (1000 B @ 1 Mb/s) into an AP; run **without** RTS/CTS, then **with** RTS/CTS (`RtsCtsThreshold = "2200"` → off; `"0"` → on). Report **throughput** and **PDR**, and compare.

CLI flags supported: `--numNodes`, `--pktSize`, `--distance`, `--seed`. 

1. **Seeds matter.** The code fixes the global seed and varies the **run**; do at least **two runs** per configuration and **average**. Example pattern: set `Run=1`, run; then `Run=2`, run again.  

2. **Visualization.** The ad-hoc and hidden starters write **NetAnim XML**; open these if you need to sanity-check topology and activity.  

## Throughput: how we compute it
* Apps start at **t=1 s** and stop at **t=10 s** → measure over **9 seconds**. The UDP starters already compute `throughput = rxBytes * 8 / 9.0`.  
* The TCP starter divides by **10.0** even though it also sends from **1–10 s**. If you want strict comparability, recompute using **9 seconds**. Otherwise you’ll under-report TCP by ~11%.

## What to look out for (common failure modes)

* **“Throughput = 0” on the chain?** You forgot **routing**. Multi-hop packets won’t forward themselves. Enable a routing helper (OLSR/AODV) or populate static routes. The lab spec requires routing to be enabled; the instruction sheet also calls out this exact gotcha.  

* **Your nodes all hear each other?** Then you broke the geometry. Keep **200 m spacing** and **Two-Ray**, and place nodes **on a straight line** so only neighbors are in range. 

* **Hidden-terminal confusion:** That starter intentionally uses **AP/STA MACs** (infra) with `StaWifiMac` and `ApWifiMac`. That’s fine for demonstrating RTS/CTS, but don’t mix it up with IBSS used in the chain experiments. 

* **PHY vs app throughput:** Don’t expect **1 Mb/s** at the application. Airtime is burned on headers, ACKs, IFS, and contention. Comparing your measured numbers to the **nominal 1 Mb/s** is part of the task. 

* **Driving the link hard:** The app data rate is intentionally set high to saturate the link (UDP uses **1 Mb/s** in the starters; TCP uses **5 Mb/s**). That’s by design.   

* **FlowMonitor indexing:** Starters assume your main flow is **ID 1**. If you add more apps/flows, don’t hard-index blindly.  

## Exactly what to hand in (minimum)

1. A table of averaged throughputs for every **(#stations, pktSize)** combination. 
2. **Two plots**:

   * Throughput vs **packet size** for each **#stations**. 
   * Throughput vs **#stations** at **1200 B**. 
3. A short comparison of **TCP vs UDP** on the 3-node chain (use **300 B** and **1200 B**). 
4. For hidden terminals: results **with/without RTS/CTS**, including **throughput** and **PDR**, and a brief explanation of the difference. 

## Useful command examples

* **UDP chain (single case):**
  `Lab3_Cpp_Adhoc --numNodes=5 --pktSize=700 --distance=200 --seed=2` 

* **Payload sweep (inside the sweep program):** it iterates `{300,700,1200}` for you and prints throughput for each. 

* **TCP (3 nodes, segment size = 1200):**
  `Lab3_Cpp_TCP --pktSize=1200 --seed=1` (remember the 9 s window if you recompute throughput). 

* **Hidden terminal (RTS/CTS ON):** set `RtsCtsThreshold="0"` before installing devices, then run.
