Used Hotspot on Iphone XR to simulate ad-hoc (as new OS Updates from Macbooks removed Adhoc possiblity). 
Calculated with 20dBm TX power and 2.4GHz frequency.

Why the pathloss measurement and Friis Model does not match can be of multiple factors:
- Friis assumes: free space, far-field, perfect LOS, isotropic antennas, no reflections, no shadowing, fixed Tx power, matched polarization. Indoors violates most of these.
- Indoor corridor: strong multipath and shadowing from walls, doors, metal, and people lead to extra attenuation and fast fading. This adds a near-constant offset (~+13 dB at 1 m) and increases slope beyond 20 dB/decade.
- Antenna effects: laptop/phone antennas are directional and probably also detuned by hands
- TX power: 20 dBm is an assumption, the hotspot likely uses power control and unspecified antenna gain.
- Receiver limits: RSSI bottoms at âˆ’91 dBm from 20m onward.
- Bandwidth/interference: 2.4 GHz is busy. Co-channel interference and noise raise effective loss compared to an empty free-space channel.

Additional note:
- Measurement imprecision: values were collected with assumptions and approximate positioning, not with calibrated equipment or controlled test setup. This introduces further error and variability.
